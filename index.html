  <div class="introduction">
    <p>
      I am a fourth year computer science student from the University of British Columbia, and have always been
      interested in technology and how it can impact those around us. The area I am most passionate about and
      comfortable with is front end development, as it is rewarding to build interfaces that are tangible and work for
      the user.

            During my co-op term at Vidyard, I worked to create new features to add to our core set, while maintaining
            legacy parts of the platform. I contributed towards key projects, such as video level analytics, a text
            replies system, and improving tracking for analytics. I also helped bring automated end-to-end tests to
            Vidyard.
