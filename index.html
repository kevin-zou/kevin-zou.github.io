        <span class="sub-title">Board Structure</span>
        <p>We believe that the Board needs a bit of restructuring and rehashing of responsibilities in order for the entire team run more efficiently. We've approached this in length, created a proposal (which you can find <a href="./assets/board-reform-proposal.pdf">here</a>), got some feedback, and now here are the changes!</p>
        <p>TLDR:</p>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>Administration department is revived, now handles room bookings, internal meetings, and club room</li>
          <li>Communications role is being reevaluated at the moment - we are proposing the department be split into separate teams of Design and Marketing, but it is still being discussed. It will not be included in the this election</li>
          <li>Externals stays the same</li>
          <li>Finance will be the same, with the exception of making decisions for funding events with the Co-Presidents</li>
          <li>Human Resources stays the same</li>
          <li>Internals takes on all UBC facing communications (no longer goes to President)</li>
          <li>and finally, doubling the number of Presidents should make for better work and a stronger, more feasible division of labour. It will also allow for an increased presence at all club events</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div id="competitive-teams" class="section">
        <span class="sub-title">Competitive Teams</span>
        <p>Neither of us have worked too closely with competitive teams, so we apologize in advance for any naive perspectives. We'll really be looking to those with more experience to provide their input.</p>

        <p>We believe that our relationship with competitive teams is quite poor. Our relationship consists of paying some/all of their competitive fees and providing jerseys for them. There is not much we get in return. We'd like to more deeply ingrain the competitive teams in our everyday agenda, so that both the competitive and organizing sides feel more connected and on the same page.</p>

        <p>Towards this goal we plan to hire for a role specifically tasked to keep an overview on all our competitive facing operations and act as a liaison for our teams. This person would not replace any current staff or infrastructure we have in place, but instead would act as a bridge to further our mutual understanding. The initiative will be spearheaded by the future board and by those intensely involved with competitive teams in the pastâ€”who are the most equipped to do so.</p>

        <p>TLDR:</p>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>we want to hire somebody to specifically focus on competitive scene health and our connection with them</li>
          <li>we want to engage more with our competitive teams and have them be more than just updates in our meetings whenever they place well</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div id="executive-team" class="section">
        <span class="sub-title">Executive Team</span>
        <p>Generally we believe that the bar for all club members can be pushed way up. We plan to hire less Executives and focus specifically on skills that fit within a team (e.g. a social media manager for Marketing). When all is said and done, we're aiming for a more efficient number of Executives.</p>

        <p>We are asking for a higher level of commitment from our Executive team, and that means putting in more hours per week. Making this very explicit in hirings will help with accountability and ensuring that our candidates know what they are getting into.</p>

        <p>TLDR:</p>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>we want fewer but more dedicated Executives</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div id="event-planning" class="section">
        <span class="sub-title">Event Planning</span>
        <p>Our vision for how future event planning takes place is to move to a proposal based system. Instead of Game Directors planning and running their events in a vacuum, we will mandate the submission of a formal proposal that outlines high level aspects of the event.</p>

        <p>This system is not meant to restrict the creativity of our game departments, but instead promote careful foresight and discussion for when we plan events. Having these proposals viewable by the rest of the club will bring in feedback, which helps prevent pitfalls and potential problems.</p>

        <p>These proposals will be required to be submitted well before the event takes place, which also enables our assets and resource related teams (e.g. Design, Marketing) to have enough time to prepare.</p>

        <p>The hallmark of a successful team is a team that thinks about what they are doing and how they can improve. When you take a step back, look critically at your yourself, and then work to make that better, *that* is when you experience the most growth.</p>

        <p>We really want to push for those critical discussions and more retrospectives. By having this space to continually improve and build on our experiences, we won't have to "restart" every year with a new team. The difference between only planning events and looking at the bigger picture can be summed up in the difference between these two questions:</p>

        <ul class="list">
          <li>What can I do to make the event better?</li>
          <li>What can our team do to improve how we approach event planning?</li>
        </ul>
