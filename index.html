            As a part of the Patient Growth team, I worked closely with product and design to deliver value to our core

          <ul>
            <li>migrating features and pages from Angular to a new React app</li>
            <li>adding Google SSO to our platform to improve user experience</li>
            <li>maintaining and refactoring legacy code in our API</li>
            <li>primary investigation of core booking feature, revealing bugs and issues that affected its accuracy</li>

            During my co-op term at Vidyard, I worked to create new features to add value to the product's "Pro" tier
            offering, while maintaining legacy parts of the platform. My contributions in my first co-op position were:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>allowing users to leave text replies on a video</li>
            <li>adding to video level analytics</li>
            <li>improving how we track video views</li>

            Organized nwHacks, Western Canada's largest 24-hour hackathon, and its transition to becoming a virtual event. I collaborated with other members to develop creative solutions for the online event and helped bring in record numbers for attendees and project submissions.
          </p>
          <p>
            I played a major role in coordinating streaming logistics resulting in a 24-hour Twitch stream that had peak viewership numbers of 400 concurrent viewers. For this I used the software Streamlabs to bring professional transitions and layouts to the stream.

            As Co-President I am responsible for overseeing all UBC Esports Association operations, largely through
            direct leadership of the Executive Board. The esports industry is one that is fairly new, and many groups
            experience difficulties scaling due to a lack of structure. During my term I aim to develop the executive
            team with an emphasis on team culture and building strong fundamentals for future years.

          </div>
          <p>
            As Marketing Director I am responsible for overseeing marketing and promotional efforts for three hackathons
            in the Pacific Northwest:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>UBC Local Hack Day, a beginner friendly workshop series and 12-hour hackathon (400+ participants)</li>
            <li>nwHacks, Western Canada's largest 24-hour hackathon (800+ participants)</li>
            <li>cmd-f, an all female* 24-hour hackathon (150+ participants)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            One of my goals is to create marketing strategies focusing on genuine interactions with our audience and a
            voice that is warm and meaningful. To reach this goal this year, the marketing team began programs such as
            nwPlus You, highlighting the stories and projects of event participants, and the Campus Ambassador Program,
            more closely connecting nwPlus with the students at other educational institutions.

          <p>
            My role as the Vice President Human Resources is to lead the acquisition and organization of the internal
            team and promote a strong team culture. I believe that a strong presence in the community begins internally,
            and my primary focus is to provide the opportunity for our team members to organically bond and develop
            their skills by learning from others.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since I entered this position I have moved our communications and collaboration to Slack and Notion,
            championed major improvements for overall transparency, and organized regular and consistent team socials
            and outings. I have also streamlined internal processes such as team meetings and documentation.
