  <h1>i like games and i like people</h1>
  <p>People like you, who help UBC eSports become better. People like you, who genuinely love the games you play. For far too long we haven't been paying attention to you guys.</p>

  <p><em>It's time to put community first.</em></p>

  <h2>starting off with the basics</h2>
  <h6>tldr: restructure the executive team so it is more connected = greater support for connecting the community</h6>
  <p>How can you foster and grow a community if you don't start with one? One of my core ideals is to develop a strong, interconnected, and driven executive team.</p>
  <p>The current structure for the executive team encourages individual game departments to just "mind their own business". Only through attending team socials did I really get to know some of the amazing people I was working with - but even then, <em>not everybody goes to these</em>.</p>
  <p>As VP HR, I will work tirelessly with the rest of the club to develop a foundation that enables us to actively seek out engagement with not only our own respective game communities, but other communities as well. This not only applies to our lovely executive team, but also to <strong>you</strong>.</p>
  <p>How many times have you thought, "I wish I could play [insert game], but I have nobody to learn it with or teach me :("? With an executive team that <em>understands that feeling</em> there will be many more opportunities to feed and be a noob with friends.</p>

  <h2>voices!</h2>
  <p>One of my largest frustrations as an executive was how impossible it seemed to get your voice heard. The only time I ever got my ideas across was through informal, spur of the moment conversations I had with other executives (whether it be in the lounge or just before midnight in some Church's Chicken god knows where).</p>
  <p>If it was this hard for me to voice my opinions I can't imagine how difficult it would be for other execs who don't have access to those casual conversations or for the community.</p>
