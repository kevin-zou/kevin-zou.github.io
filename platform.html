  <p>Below is my complete platform, and I hope you will support me throughout this election and the upcoming year :)</p>

  <h2>starting off with the basics</h2>
  <h6>tldr: more training, more standards, better execs</h6>
  <p>You can't build a house from the top and you sure can't build an exec team without first developing their fundamental skills. With an aim to promote a community-first attitude among all execs, I will work tirelessly with the rest of the club to set higher standards for our executives and hold them to it.</p>
  <p>To achieve this goal I plan to hold workshops and training sessions with our executives, where meaningful and constructive discussion about how we can improve ourselves takes place. I will support and encourage executives to take a lead in their own development as a member of the club.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>voices!</h2>
  <h6>tldr: exec voices get buffed, more exec meetings</h6>
  <p>One of my largest frustrations as an executive was how impossible it seemed to get your voice heard. The only time I ever got my ideas across was through informal, spur of the moment conversations I had with other executives (whether it be in the lounge or just before midnight in some Church's Chicken god knows where).</p>
  <p>If it was this hard for me to voice my opinions I can't imagine how difficult it would be for other execs who don't have access to these casual conversations. One of my most important goals is to give power back to executives to make their ideas and opinions heard. I will be achieving this through reorganizing our channels of communication so that casual chit chat and "serious stuff" are clearly separated and by pushing for more executive team wide meetings.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>executive love &lt;3</h2>
  <h6>tldr: more team socials overall, but especially in the summer</h6>
  <p>How can you foster and grow a community if you don't start with one? One of my core ideals is to develop a strong, interconnected, and driven executive team.</p>
  <p>I want to take the initiative in promoting a healthy club culture by providing many more team bonding opportunities. In particular, I am very excited to plan summer team socials - the weather is great, we are (kinda) free from school, and most importantly <strong>we're ready <em>before</em> the school year starts</strong>.</p>
  <p>I will also be looking to continue and add on to club traditions such as Executive Tea Time and just going out for dinner with everybody!</p>
