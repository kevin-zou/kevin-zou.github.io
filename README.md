## Goodbye
It was a short but good run with this site. Ultimately I wanted a different look and feel to the site so it has been reborn over at [@kevin-zou/personal-site](https://github.com/kevin-zou/personal-site)! I'll keep this up for the time being as I don't need the domain for anything else. Thanks for stopping by!

## About this
This repo is for my personal website, hosted using Github pages! This will be a sort of living document to show some cool things that I've learned about web development.

This website is built using HTML/CSS and Javascript (with the jQuery library).

I've seen a lot of people with some really amazing sites, and always thought, "Oh I'll never have one that looks that good." So this is my response to that feeling - an attempt to make a nice personal portfolio and show the progress on the way. I hope that this inspires or motivates you to start that project that you've been putting off!

## Future plans
- [x] Add some nice animations to everything and give it a *wow* factor :)) 
- [x] **Maybe** migrate this website to a React/Vue app. I'm a little torn on this one since I feel like it increases the complexity of my site and makes it harder to approach/understand for those unfamiliar
